# Presence-Insights
The Presence Insights report gives HR a clear view of employee attendance, showing the percentage of employees present each day, including work-from-home (WFH) patterns and sick leave rates. HR can use this data to track daily attendance trends, identify patterns in WFH usage, and monitor sick leave percentages over time.
